# Contributing an Instant Answer

An overview of how to submit an Instant Answer can [be found over in our docs](http://docs.duckduckhack.com/submitting/submitting-overview.html).

#### Chosing a title for your pull request: 

If your IA is new, use the format: `"New {IA TOPIC} {IA TYPE}"`. For example:

	- "New Instagram Spice"
	- "New Firefox Cheat Sheet"
	- "New Color Hex Goodie"
	
If you're submitting a fix, use the format: `"{IA NAME}: Fixes #ISSUE"` as the title and description (Conveniently, this syntax will auto-close the Github issue when your pull request is merged.). For example:
	
	- "Forecast: Fixes #3434"
	- "Cheat Sheet: Fixes #4102"
	



Dont forget to paste your **[Instant Answer Page URL](https://duck.co/ia/new_ia)** in the description field, while creating new pull requests.
