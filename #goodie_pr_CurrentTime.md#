# Goodie Pull Request Template

We ask that you please use this template when submitting an instant answer pull request so we can better understand it and help you along when necessary.

**What does your instant answer do?**
Responds with current time, date, and zone in specified time zone.

**What problem does your instant answer solve (Why is it better than organic links)?**
Someone just wants to know what time it is somewhere. We can provide an instant answer to that question rather than have them search another page for it.

**What is the data source for your instant answer? (Provide a link if possible)**
Data source is the tz file on the server, the Olson timezone list, leveraged through DateTime.

**Why did you choose this data source?**
It's native and it's fast.

**Are there any other alternative (better) data sources?**
Not really, anything else that runs native or runs this fast is using the same ultimate source.

**What are some example queries that trigger this instant answer?**
primary_example_queries "current time in Tokyo", "time in New York";
secondary_example_queries "London time", "what time is it in chicago";

**Which communities will this instant answer be especially useful for? (gamers, book lovers, etc)**
anybody who is traveling or has friends/coworkers/clients in another location

**Is this instant answer connected to an [Ideas.DuckDuckHack](https://duckduckhack.uservoice.com/forums/5168-ideas-for-duckduckgo-instant-answer-plugins) or [Duck.co](http://duck.co/) thread?**
yes, it's at https://dukgo.com/ideas/idea/38/use-other-source-or-develop-as-a-goodie-current

**Which existing instant answers will this one supercede/overlap with?**
There is currently an instant answer which queries Wolfram Alpha for current time information. This goodie was requested in uservoice because the current instant answer is slow loading on the page and results in a single line of text which DDG could easily provide without the extra overhead.

**Are you having any problems? Do you need our help with anything?**
Not really so much help but I would certainly appreciate any pointers, particularly with the knotty problem of a vague query asking for time resulting in multiple time zone matches, still working on how to handle that situation.

**\*\*Note:** Please attach a screenshot for new instant answer pull requests, and for pull requests which modify the look/design of existing instant answers.


##Checklist
Please place a ✔ where appropriate.
Haven't fully tested yet but wanted to get a pull request in so I could get some feedback and make sure I'm on the right track. I've run dzil test and I haven't broken anything so that's a good sign. I'll be writing my tests shortly.
