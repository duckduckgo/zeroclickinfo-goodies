# ABSTRACT: Return currency type(s) in given country

# TODO: At the moment it return value only if user inputs the whole country name...
#     ...if user types "Salvador" instead of "El Salvador" then no results...
# TODO: think about how often currency in countries changes? 
#     Parser (for Wikipedia) is included in share directory...

# In some countries there are more than one currency.
# For that reason values in hash are stored as arrays. (loaded from .txt as comma separated values )
# Example: %countries( "Zimbabwe"=>["A","B"], "Slovakia"=>["A"], ... )"

# Working examples for queries:
# What currency do I need in Egypt ?
# What currency will I need for Zimbabwe
# What is the currency used in Slovakia
# currency in Russia
# What type of currency do I need for Russia?

# Countries are lowercased but input from user, too ... so those always match...
# ...country is capitalized on output...
