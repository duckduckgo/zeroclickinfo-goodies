The Caesar cipher (named after Julius Caesar) is one of the most basic
ciphers. It is a form of substitution cipher in which each letter of
the alphabet is replaced with another letter a fixed number of places
before or after it.

If you are given the key for a Caesar cipher, then decrypting the
message is easy: first take 26 away from the key until you are left
with a number between 0 and 25 (add 26 each time for negative keys),
then shift each letter by the resulting number in the opposite
direction. For example, if you had the text "zljyla", and you knew the
key was 33, then taking 26 away from 33 you get 7 - which is between 0
and 25. Replacing each letter of the message with that 7 places before
it you get the decrypted message "secret".

If you don't know the key you can perform frequency analysis on the
encrypted message or just try every possible key (there's only 26
combinations!).
