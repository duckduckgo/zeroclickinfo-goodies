# Categories represent sets of triggers that can be
# assigned to templates or individual cheat sheets.
#
# Each category consists of a name, along with a set
# of trigger types (specifically WORD triggers - start,
# end, startend, and any) and the associated triggers.
#
# The only special category is 'default', which should be
# assigned to all template types, and will trigger any cheat
# sheet.
#
# Category syntax:
#
# # Short description of the category - i.e, what would be the general use case
# # for this category (follow the existing format as much as possible)?
# category_name:
#   trigger_type1:
#     - "trigger1"
#     - "trigger2"
#   trigger_type2:
#     - "trigger3"
#     - "trigger4"
#
# Where "trigger_type" is one of start, end, startend, or any.
#
# NOTE: The use of 'any' is highly discouraged as it is unstable and
# may not perform as expected.
#
# NOTE: Categories should be in alphabetical (lexical) order (and preferably the
# triggers and trigger types as well) - this ensures it is as easy as possible
# to find relevant categories.

# You shouldn't need to touch this.
#
# Specifies the categories that are automatically assigned to any
# cheat sheet using the given template_type.
#
# Each map takes the form:
#
# template_type:
#   - "category1"
#   - "category2"
#   - ...
#
# Where the categories allowed are those specified in the 'categories'
# section.
#
# When specifying a template map, you should always include the "default"
# category unless you have good reason - as this will ensure cheat sheets
# using that category will use the default triggers.
#
# NOTE: Templates and categories should be in alphabetical order - this makes
# it easier to find appropriate templates.

# Custom cheat sheet triggers.
#
# Format:
#
# cheat_sheet_id:
#   additional_categories:
#     - "category1",
#     - "category2"
#   triggers:
#     startend:
#       - "some trigger"
#       - "another trigger"
#     any:
#       - "yet another trigger"
#
# 'cheat_sheet_id' MUST match the ID of the cheat sheet you wish
# these changes to apply to.
#
# 'additional_categories' specifies a list of categories, as defined
# in the 'categories' section, and may be omitted.
#
# For the format of 'triggers', please see the section describing the syntax
# of 'categories' - the format is the same (bar the name).
#
# For example, say we have a cheat sheet called 'calculus cheat sheet',
# that presents various formulae for working with calculus.
#
# The cheat sheet is contained in the 'calculus.json' file, and has the ID
# 'calculus_cheat_sheet'.
#
# As there is (at the time of writing) no support for a 'math' template type,
# yet it is desirable to trigger on things like 'calculus equations' and
# 'calculus formula sheet', we can use the 'math' category with custom triggers;
# this would be specified like so:
#
# calculus_cheat_sheet:
#   additional_categories:
#     - "math"
#   triggers:
#     startend:
#       - "equation sheet"
#       - "formula sheet"
#
# And now it will be able to trigger on 'calculus equations',
# 'calculus formula sheet', 'equation sheet calculus' etc...
#
# NOTE: IDs should be in alphabetical order (and the categories and triggers) as
# much as possible to ensure it is as easy as possible to locate triggers.
