# Welcome to DuckDuckHack!
We're a community of open source developers from around the world, contributing code to improve the DuckDuckGo search engine.


### The Programming Mission
We want every programming search to have great results, providing the information you need instantly. The Programming Mission empowers the community to create Instant Answers for reference, libraries, help, and tools.

For now, we are **only accepting Pull Requests and Issues related to the Programming Mission**.


## How to contribute
- [**Create new Goodie Instant Answers, and improve existing ones**](https://github.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-goodies/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A"Mission%3A+Programming")
    - **Note**: Goodies are written in Perl (back-end) and JavaScript (front-end). They can also typically use CSS, and [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com) Templates.

### What are Goodie Instant Answers?
Goodies retrieve data from third-party JSON APIs. An API call is generated at the time of the query, and the JSON data returned is used to build an Instant Answer result on the front-end.

#### Example: NPM Goodie
- [Code](https://github.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-goodies/blob/master/lib/DDG/Goodie/JsMinify.pm) | [Example Query](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=js+minifer&t=opera&ia=web) | [Instant Answer Page](https://duck.co/ia/view/js_minify)
