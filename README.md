# DuckDuckHack Codio Project - Welcome!

If you're new here be sure to checkout the [DuckDuckHack Documentation](https://dukgo.com/duckduckhack/ddh-intro) to learn more!

## What is this?
This project exists to provide developers with a pre-configured environment for DuckDuckHack Instant Answer development.

This box comes with the following installed:
 - Perl 5.18 (via perlbrew)
 - DuckPAN
 - All Perl dependencies required for testing both Goodies and Spice
 
## How do I use this?

We have a great [quickstart tutorial](https://duck.co/duckduckhack/goodie_quickstart) that will walk you through everything!

**tldr;**

1. Get a GitHub Account
2. Get a Codio Account
3. Fork this project (Project->Fork, clone both the **project** and the **box**)
4. Fork the [zeroclickinfo-goodies](https://github.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-goodies) and/or [zeroclickinfo-spice](https://github.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-spice) repo on GitHub.com
5. `git clone` the zeroclickinfo-goodies and/or zeroclickinfo-spice repo onto your Codio machine
