**What does your Instant Answer do?**
 - The goodie provided here helps the developers to make it easy to take the angular directives
   for their references easily , so that they can use it in their applications ,i personally felt this
   because their are many times when i needed some directives but was not able to find it instantly rather
   i had to go to the offical site and search for angular directives.So this goodie might help some instant actions
   along with the link provided one can easily navigate to the original site , which will save time as well.
